#Example of a simple second timer

* You can either enter the number of seconds to countdown or use the buttons to add numbers to the countdown. 
* The entire program is based on simple HTML and Javacript without any use of library
* It uses simple inline style statements inside the HTML file

## To Use: 

* Open the HTML file [Countdown.html] and enter the number of seconds
* No special requirement other than having Javascript enabled inside the code

> I could have used libraries or any other builtin function but because I wanted to learn and not create an application, I decided to not use any library

> I do intend to make the application a little bit more advanced with added functionalities of minute timers and whatnot, but for the moment, I achieved my goal
